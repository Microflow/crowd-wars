# VOTING BEST PROJECTS TO THE TOP


8 projects are fighting to get to the top of the Bandung crowdfund final. Users are voting every ten minutes. The crowd sorts the best project to the top. 

We need to gamify choosing, make it fun for the user, make it exciting
## 
USER STORY
Three rounds then ONE project wins from the 8.
The winning project from each user gets assigned 10 points 
At the end of voting period (timed at 10 mins) points from all projects are added. ONLY the winning project gets points, all others score zero
So there is one winning project per time period
And the whole city will see that winner... and give money to that crowdfunded project

USER FLOW 
In round 8, let user vote it and will end it in expired times and will results 4 projects
In round 4, let user vote it and will end it in expired times and will results 2 projects
In round 2, let user vote it and will end it in expired times and will results a winner

Letâ€™s call it quarter finals, semi finals, and finals, ha 

USER FLOW SECOND EXPLANATION

QUARTER FINAL: User sees 8 projects. Clicks upvote 4 times. 
Page refreshes to show 4 projects. User chooses twice.
Page refreshes to show 2. User chooses once
Results need to logged before time expires. 
Cos user needs to go to the next challenge. 
Not sure about that yet. but lets assume 10 minute window per project
Ultimately I want the crowd to sort through many projects quickly...
There are some issues with time but we will fix them later
Also, once we get the basic code running, we can build variants. that will be fun



Yes I will do that soon. I like writing docs
Do you think we can start writing some code now?
I reckon we could get an MVP done in 90 minutes... I want to show my boss and get money

RAILS GEMS FOR VOTING

This is good for adding votes at the end. but first, we need a simple A vs B voting system

Some wisdom on app structure.
